# Notes

1. is it okay to use Expo **React Native Framework**?
2. is it okay to use **Context API** for state managment or there are any specific Libraries i should use?
3. Regarding the search functionality, should it perform an API request to fetch results, or is it intended to filter from an existing list of movies and series?
4. For the search functionality, should it be implemented within the movies/series screen, or would you prefer it on a separate dedicated screen?
